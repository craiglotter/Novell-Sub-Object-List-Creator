Novell-Sub-Object-List-Creator
==============================

Novell Object Search is a simple application that allows an user to search through objects on the Novell Network Tree of the University of Cape Town (UCT) network via LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) calls. The search generates a list of all the DN entries satisfying the search and saves a text file to the user-specified location.  Created by Craig Lotter, March 2006
